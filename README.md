## Description
Each year, over **10 million people** die from various types of addiction, including both adults and teenagers. The issue of substance abuse among the younger generation is widespread today. Finding themselves in bad company, teenagers often seek acceptance by **“Mocking”** the behavior of their peers, which can lead to sad consequences.

Mockingbird aims to educate teenagers about the destructive nature of addictive substances and how to deal with them. It's not just about knowing that addictive substances are harmful; it's crucial to understand how they work and how they can trap you.

Additionally, the app uses **AudioToolbox** to play sound effects and background music.

All assets were drawn using **Adobe Fresco** specifically for the game.
